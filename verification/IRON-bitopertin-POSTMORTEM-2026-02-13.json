This is a word-for-word confirmation of the surrogate_only thesis — the surrogate marker (PPIX) was pharmacologically valid but clinically unlinked to the primary clinical outcome. AURORA's primary endpoint was PPIX reduction (met with p<0.001 at 60mg), but the key secondary endpoint of cumulative sunlight time without pain did NOT reach statistical significance (153.1 vs 133.9 hours, NS).

The company made a critical strategic error: filing for accelerated approval using a surrogate endpoint when their own Phase 2 data (AURORA) showed the clinical endpoints were marginal. An experienced sponsor would have recognized the FDA's well-documented skepticism toward surrogate-only packages in non-oncology settings and either: (a) waited for APOLLO Phase 3 data with a clinical primary endpoint before filing, or (b) pre-negotiated the surrogate endpoint acceptability via a pre-NDA meeting. The fact that Disc filed anyway — and that the FDA needed to issue a CRL pointing them toward their own APOLLO study — suggests regulatory naivety. Their response (requesting Type A meeting) is textbook first-time sponsor behavior."
